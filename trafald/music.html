         <h1>8 REASONS WHY MUSIC IS IMPORTANT TO US</h1>
		 
		 <h3>1. The Universal Language</h3>
		 <p>While every country has it’s own language(s), there’s only one language we can all understand: the language of music. We don’t even need words to understand what music is saying. Every year I see a lot of different people from a lot of different countries attending festivals. When the music is being played, it seems every one understands what’s coming out of the speakers and they just start dancing to it.</p>
		 
		 <h3>2. Ambiance</h3>
		 <p>Music creates ambiance. It adds up to the experience of whatever you’re doing. Can you imagine a party without music, a sports event without music, or a movie without music? Probably not.</p>
		 
		 <h3>3. Music Unites</h3>
		 <p>Music plays a very important role in bringing people together. Whether it’s a festival, concert or a club night, people come together to enjoy the music that’s being played. I’ve had the privilege to attend a few big festivals in Europe, and it’s amazing to see the amount of people coming from different countries in the whole world, just to be part of the experience. At festivals like Tomorrowland or Ultra, you’ll see a lot of people from all over the world to enjoy the whole musical experience. It doesn’t matter where you come from, every one is treated the same. This is something we can all learn from.</p>
		 
		 <h3>4. Focus</h3>
		 <p>If I have to do some business related stuff, I’d like to put on some music at the background in order to focus a little better. It is scientifically proven that music enhances brain functioning. Besides, listening to music in an environment with other people also makes sure you don’t get distracted by other people’s noises. For me as a producer, a good side thing is I get inspired a lot by listening to music when I’m busy doing things. </p>
		 
		 <h3>5. Emotions</h3>
		 <p>Music can do great things for your mood. If you want to feel happy, you can listen to songs that are happy and this works the other way around too. When you lost someone in your life, it’s helpful to listen to sad songs. Science says listening to sad songs can actually make you happier. If you want to know more about this, Google knows a lot ;)</p>
		 
		 <h3>6. Imagination</h3>
		 <p>I don’t think I’m the only one who listens to music and instantly has a vision in my head of surroundings that would fit that particular music piece. Music let’s your imagination flow and that’s obviously a good thing for your creativity and health. </p>
		 
		 <h3>7. Memory</h3>
		 <p>Music is good for your memory. I bet you can remember the lyrics of a bunch of songs much better than an article you recently read. In nursing homes, they started using musical therapy in order to let the elderly remember things of their past, which they couldn’t remember without listening to music. </p>
		 
		 <h3>8. It’s just a pleasure</h3>
		 <p>I’ll close off with probably the most important reason why we listen to music. It’s just a pleasure listening to music so let’s just continue doing so! If you happen to be in need of some Techno, click here or just press play below!</p>
